        <p> Before 1994, there were no search engines or any efficient ways to search the world wide web. If you needed to find something, youâ€™d likely have to memorize the links of websites or just resign yourself to having to surf through the web through various roundabout methods such as redirect links. This all changed when a pair of Stanford students developed a search engine named Yahoo. </p>
        <p>  The students, David Filo and Jerry Yang, began their development of Yahoo when their professor went off on a year-long sabbatical, which left the two with plenty of time on their hands. However, like most startups, the pair encountered the common problem of lacking funds for the project. This is where eventually the idea came up to incorporate ads into the search engine which ended up being a huge success for Yahoo. With all this success, more and more eyes began to realize the potential that the search engine industry had. </p>
        <p>  In 1996, a new search engine by the name of Excite came onto the scene and rivalled Yahoo and its features for a time. But while these 2 went head to head, it allowed another to grow and become the tech giant we know today as Google. Google differed from the two mainly by the way they organized their search results, which would be done by most viewed sites are the top search results. At the time though, Google was a shadow of their current success, and like many others, they wrestled with financial struggles. Interestingly enough, Excite had the opportunity to purchase Google for a million dollars, which would prove to be a fatal mistake because as of 2020, Google has a worth of $632 billion. </p>
